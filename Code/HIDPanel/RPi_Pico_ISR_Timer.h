    The RPI_PICO system timer peripheral provides a global microsecond timebase for the system, and generates
    interrupts based on this timebase. It supports the following features:
    • A single 64-bit counter, incrementing once per microsecond
    • This counter can be read from a pair of latching registers, for race-free reads over a 32-bit bus.
    • Four alarms: match on the lower 32 bits of counter, IRQ on match: TIMER_IRQ_0-TIMER_IRQ_3

    Now even you use all these new 16 ISR-based timers,with their maximum interval practically unlimited (limited only by
    unsigned long miliseconds), you just consume only one RPI_PICO timer and avoid conflicting with other cores' tasks.
    The accuracy is nearly perfect compared to software timers. The most important feature is they're ISR-based timers
    Therefore, their executions are not blocked by bad-behaving functions / tasks.
    This important feature is absolutely necessary for mission-critical tasks.

    Based on SimpleTimer - A timer library for Arduino.
